# ODI Cricket Score Prediction Model

A machine learning project that predicts **One Day International (ODI) cricket scores** using historical match data and regression techniques. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction for cricket matches.

## 🔹 Overview

This repository contains a model that predicts the **final score of an ODI inning** based on input features like team performance, overs completed, wickets lost, and historical match data. The model is trained using Python and popular ML libraries.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **scikit‑learn / ML libraries** – Machine learning algorithms and preprocessing tools  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Code exploration and model training environment  
- **Pickle** (optional) – Save trained model for future use

## 💡 Features

- Loads ODI cricket match dataset (historical match data)  
- Processes and prepares data (cleaning and feature engineering)  
- Trains regression model to predict final score  
- Evaluates model performance with metrics like MAE and R²  
- Predicts score for new match situations

## 📥 Dataset

The dataset for this project is stored externally. Download it before running the notebook or model:

👉 **Dataset link:**  
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mdZ5pFsARVbR1Q6bCKksV4jnmsBPhZit/view?usp=drive_link :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Once downloaded, place the dataset file in the project folder before executing the code.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/fima0519/ODI_cricket_score_prediction_model.git
   
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
(if you have a requirements.txt. If not, install common libs like scikit‑learn, pandas, numpy, jupyter)

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook ODI_Cricket_Score_Prediction.ipynb
or,
you can run in google colab.

4.Run each cell to preprocess data, train the model, and test predictions.
